# Write a program that creates a dictionary containing states as keys,
# and their capitals as values. (Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.)
# The program should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and
# asking the user to enter that stateâ€™s capital.
# The program should keep a count of the number of correct and incorrect responses.
