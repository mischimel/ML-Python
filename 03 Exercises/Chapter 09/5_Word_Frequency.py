# Write a program that reads the contents of a text file.
# The program should create a dictionary in which the keys are the individual words found
# in the file and the values are the number of times each word appears.
# For example, if the word “the” appears 128 times, the dictionary would contain an element
# with 'the' as the key and 128 as the value. The program should either display the frequency of
# each word or create a second file containing a list of each word and its frequency
